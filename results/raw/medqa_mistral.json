    "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",

The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs.

There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun.

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with difficulty breathing for the last 3 hours. Upon asking about other symptoms, he mentions that he had a cough for the last 4 months which he attributes to his smoking. He says he had frequent nasal stuffiness and headaches over the last 3 months, for which he takes over-the-counter cold medications and analgesics. Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history.

On arrival, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands, but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
