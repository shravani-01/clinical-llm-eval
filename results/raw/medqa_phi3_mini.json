    "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",

The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs.

The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken.

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

    "question": "A 31-year-old G1-P0 woman at 28-weeks gestation presents with shortness of breath and nonspecific right-sided chest pain that is worse with inspiration. She works as a graduate student at the local university, and she informs you that she recently returned to the west coast from a trip to New York for an Economics conference. Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%.

Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the \u201cbreath of a demon\u201d.
