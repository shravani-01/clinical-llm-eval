It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",Pharmacology,AIIMS 2018

(Sullivan and Harris- 1958, Harris- 1963 ) 
The dental status Of children between 7 to 14 years of age residing at Hopewood House, Bowral New South Wales, was studied longitudinally for 10 years. Almost all these children had lived from early infancy at Hopewood House. 
All lived on a strictly natural diet, that, with the exception of on occasional serving of egg yolk, was entirely vegetable in nature and largely raw. The absence of meat and restriction of refined carbohydrate were the principal features of the Hopewood House diet. 
The meals were supplemented by vitamin concentrates and an occasional serving of nuts and a sweetening agent such as honey. The fluoride content of water and food was insignificant and no tea was consumed. 
TURKU SUGAR STUDY 
(Scheinin and Makinen in 975) 
The study was carried outin Turku, Finland. 
Aim Of the study 
To compare the cariogenicity of sucrose, fructose and Xylitol. 
Basis of the study 
XylitoI is a sweet substance not metabolized by plaque micro organisms.
Key Concept:
In Hopewood house study : the children's oral hygiene was poor, calculus is uncommon,  but  gingivitis  was  prevalent  in 75%  of  children. This work  showed  that,  in institutionalized  children  at  least,  dental caries  can  be  reduced  by  a  spartan  diet, without the beneficial effects of fluoride  and in the presence of unfavorable oral hygiene.

In mild preeclampsia – if gestational age is > than labour induced should be 37 wks (here in the question = gestational age is >37 weeks). Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.

“There is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)”.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
Thus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.
PIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate – so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment.

The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

The viscosity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate. 
The tomato-based food condiment ketchup is also pseudoplastic, which makes it difficult to remove from a bottle. Shaking the bottle or rapping the side of the bottle increases its shear rate, decreases its viscosity, and improves its pourability.

Congenital disease in diabetes mellitus
Option a i.e. Results due to free radical injury - True -
Congenital malformation in a case of diabetes can be due to variety of reasons like, Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 287

Genetic susceptibility
Hyperglycemia - It is seen that good glycemic control indicated by HbAIC levels < %.9 can significantly lower the risk of fetal malformation.
Arachidonic acid deficiency
Ketone body formation
Free Radical injury
Somatomedin inhibition.

Option b–6 to 10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality
Here we will have to read the option very carefully - the option is talking about Major congenital anomalities and not all anomalies.
Dutta Obs 6/e, p- 287 says overall incidence of congenital Malformations is 6-10%.
Williams 24/e p 1128. “The incidence of major malformations in women with type I diabetes is ~ 5%”
Hence option b is incorrect
Option c - 1 - 2% of newborns are associated with single umbilical artery
This option can be taken in + /– status because no where the incidence of single umbilical artery in a case of diabetes has been mentioned separately.
Whatever little information we have is from Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 220
Single umbilical artery:

It is present in 1-2% cases (overall)
May be due to failure of development of artery or due to its atrophy in later months
It is seen in case of

i. Twins
ii. Babies born to diabetic mothers
iii. In polyhydramines

Single umbilical artery has been associated with congenital malformations of the fetus in 10-20% cases viz- Renal & Genital anomalies and fetal Trisomy
There is increased incidence of abortions, prematurity, IUGR and increased perinatal mortality.

Option d- insulin can be given
There is no doubt as far as this option is concerned as insulin is the TOC for controlling hyperglycemia in case of diabetes in pregnancy.
So from above discussion it is clear that option ‘b’ is absolutely incorrect, so we are opting it out.",Gynaecology & Obstetrics,

The maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:

Amount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.
Direction of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.
	In most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
	However, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.
Duration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.
Frequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.

Key Concept:
According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.

Sign and symptoms of Brain tumors in children

Children with brain tumors frequently have symptoms and signs that strongly suggest the appropriate diagnosis.
The clinical triad of symptoms associated with increased ICT -4 headache, vomiting, blurred vision / diplopia, is the hallmark of brain tumors in childhood.
These symptoms occur more frequently with mid-line posterior fossa (infratentorial) tumors owing to the propensity of lesions close to the ventricular CSF flow system.
Symptoms of the brain tumors vary depending upon which part of the brain the tumor is found :­

Brain tumor in cerebrum (supratentorial)

Seizures                                 o Hemiperes is or Hemiplegia          o Drowsiness / confusion
Visual changes                     o T ICT (less common)                        o Personality changes

Brain tumor in brain stem

Seizures                                 o Diplopia             o Respiratory changes o T ICT (Rare)
Endocrine problem (DM) o Headache            o Cranial N. palsy

Brain tumor in cerebellum

T ECT (most common)     o Headache          o Uncoordinated movement
Vomiting                               o Ataxia

Symptoms due to raised ICT --> These are mainly caused by midline posterior fossa tumor --> Medulloblastoma.

Headache                                                    o Nausea                                                  o Drowsiness
Vomiting (usually in the morning)         o Personality changes                         o Papilledema
Diplopia / blurred vision                           o Irritability

Approximately 70%of individuals with hyper lgM syndrome have the X linked form of the disease , caused by mutations in the gene coding CD40L located on Xq26. In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia.

Rheumatic fever is an acute immunologically mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
The disease is immune mediated, not a communicable disease.
	Epidemiology ofAcute Rheumatic fever.
The epidemiology of acute Rheumatic fever is identical to that of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.
As is the case of streptococcal sore throat, acute rheumatic fever most often occurs in children, the peak age related incidence is between 5-15 years.
Epidemiological risk factor for rheumatic fever, include lower standards of living especially crowding, the disease has been more common among socially and economically disadvantaged populations.

Pathogenesis of Rheumatic fever

It is strongly suspected that acute Rheumatic fever is a hypersensitivity reaction induced by group A streptococci but the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain despite many years of investigation.
Although the precise factor or factors that confer this property are unknown, highly rheumatogenic strains, share certain biological characteristic.
It is believed that antibodies directed against the M proteins of certain strains cross reacts with glycoprotein antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues. These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).
The M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response. These antibodies against the M proteins cross reacts with glycoproteins antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues because these glycoproteins share similar features with M antigenic domain.",Pediatrics,

Low-energy photons that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path. 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.

What could be the probable diagnosis –,VSD large,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Ebstein anomaly,AP window defect,1,single,"livpolastic left heart syndrome 

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).
Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:

(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body
Entrace and exit of the ventricle
Mitral and aortic valves

This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic

arteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two
of these connections:
(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)
Ductus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)

Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.
Babies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).

Symptoms

At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:


Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color
Cold hands and feed (extremities)


Lethargy


Poor pulse
Poor suckling and feeding
Pounding heart
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath.
Since the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.
Signs of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.

Ventricular septal defect

These patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.
They usually present with congestive cardiac failure.

Ebstein's anomaly 

Ebstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.
These patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.
They may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.

Aorticopulmonary window defect

An Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.
In these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.",Pediatrics,

These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.
Proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.
