    "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab.

Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\n\nOption A: A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\nOption B: A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.\nOption C: A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.\nOption D: A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.\n\nWhat is the correct option? State only the letter."

She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness.

A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy.

There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung.

His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?\n\nOption A: Leaden paralysis\nOption B: Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning\nOption C: Stereotypies\nOption D: Mania\n\nWhat is the correct option? State only the letter."

The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 135 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.7 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.0 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.5 mEq/L\n\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nHematocrit: 35%\nReticulocyte count: 4.9%\nPlatelet count: 275,000/mm^3\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?\n\nA: IM haloperidol\nB: Clozapine\nC: Urine toxicology\nD: ANA and anti-dsDNA levels\n\nYour answer (A, B, C, or D):",
